    "Have you noticed the rise of niche travel experiences lately? From concerts to sports, Indians are going the distance to catch the action live. In fact, sports tourism has always been part of India’s travel scene, but recently, it’s reached an entirely new scale. Just think about how many people you know who would travel to watch India play a final. But what’s driving this shift? We explore the trend in today’s edition. Read on to get the deets.\n",

    "\n",

    "The newest sustainable design choice? Pineapple skin for decor\n",
    "\n",
    "Who would’ve thought pineapple leaves could shape the future of design? In the Philippines, what was once agricultural waste is now pinyapel — a sustainable material turning up in everything from wall panels to lighting fixtures. Pinyapel, a material crafted from repurposed pineapple fibres, is redefining eco-conscious interiors with its natural texture and refined aesthetic.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "The journey of pinyapel begins with locally-sourced pineapple leaves, carefully dried, pulped, and pressed into durable sheets. The result is a unique, textured material that seamlessly blends sustainability with style. Its neutral tones and natural fibres allow it to complement a wide range of designs, from minimalist to rustic.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond wall panels and furniture, the material is also making its way into everyday living spaces in creative ways. It is used in lighting design, where its organic texture diffuses light beautifully, creating a warm, natural ambiance. On the other hand, some designers are experimenting with it in cabinetry and decorative partitions, offering a sustainable alternative to wood. In commercial spaces, it is finding its place in eco-friendly packaging, artisanal paper products, and even biodegradable coffee cups, reinforcing its practicality beyond interiors.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "As artisans and designers continue to explore its versatility, pinyapel is becoming a statement. By transforming agricultural byproducts into purposeful design, it showcases the potential of natural resources, turning something once overlooked into something truly extraordinary.\n",

    "In Granada, flamenco is a living tradition, deeply tied to Andalusian, Romani, and Moorish heritage. The city’s Sacromonte caves echo with the sounds of soulful singing, rhythmic guitar, and percussive footwork, carrying on an art form passed down through generations. Performances there feel intimate and raw, whether in a historic tablao or an impromptu street gathering. More than entertainment, flamenco in Granada reflects history, resilience, and deep emotion — expressed through every note, movement, and heartfelt verse.\n",
    "\n",
    "­\n",
    "If you’re looking for a meeting point of cultures, history, and coastal beauty that surprises at every turn on your next trip, Djerba, Tunisia, may just be the place for you. Winding alleys lead to hidden underground olive mills and bustling artisan shops, evoking a sense of timelessness. The island’s striking street art — found on medina walls and tucked-away corners — adds a vibrant, contemporary layer to its rich past. Shaped by trade, migration, and tradition, Djerba lingers in your memory long after you leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "­\n",
    "Asia’s food scene stretches far beyond the familiar staples that often define it globally. While dishes like sushi, dim sum, and curry dominate the conversation, the continent’s culinary identity is shaped by centuries of regional traditions, cross-cultural influences, and hyper-local ingredients. Take China’s Teochew cuisine, for example. It champions subtlety, from stir-fried kway teow, (a flat rice noodle dish) to crisp oyster omelettes. Or, perhaps Jeonju from South Korea that serves up heritage on a plate, from bibimbap to time-honoured rice wine taverns. Across Asia, food remains an ever-evolving story. \n",
    "\n",

    "There are many reasons to put Mexico on your travel list, but none compare to the wealth of history and culture that you can find in its lesser-known interiors. Away from the hustle and bustle (and the crowds), you may uncover villages where life moves unhurriedly or stumble upon islands where the horizon feels exclusively yours. While Cancun’s resorts and San Miguel de Allende’s art scene captivate visitors, Mexico’s soul also thrives in its quiet towns and unspoiled coastlines. Where should you start? There is a comprehensive guide to exploring this part of Mexico that you can find by following this link.\n",

    "Sport tourism is changing how we travel in more ways than one\n",
    "\n",
    "From football fans flying across continents for the FIFA World Cup to adventure seekers rafting in Rishikesh, sports tourism is thriving. Once a niche market, it has now become a major driver of global travel, with India witnessing a remarkable surge in interest.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, sports tourism falls into two categories. Passive sports tourism is about travelling to witness events — be it matches, races, or tournaments — giving host cities an economic boost. Active sports tourism, on the other hand, is all about participation, from skiing and trekking to marathon running. In India, Manali, Ladakh, and Goa have become popular choices for such experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "The industry is driven by the lure of experiencing live sporting moments, as well as the growing trend of combining travel with fitness. The Tour de France, for example, attracts both spectators and cyclists keen to ride the same routes as professionals. Meanwhile, Formula 1 races and cricket tours are drawing younger, more diverse travellers.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "As major tournaments expand and new destinations invest in hosting, the future of sports tourism looks bright—reinforcing that, for both fans and athletes, the world is an open arena.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you know that you can go bird-watching in many parts across the country?\n",
    "\n",
    "As winter bids adieu to India, the landscape transforms into a paradise for birdwatchers. This migratory season is as much about spotting rare species from around the world as it is a chance to explore some of the country’s most breathtaking destinations. From the misty wetlands of Bharatpur, to the vast expanse of Chilika Lake, birds arrive in droves, escaping the harsh northern winters.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the finest places to witness this seasonal spectacle is a former royal hunting ground in Rajasthan, Keoladeo National Park is now one of the finest places to witness this seasonal spectacle. Its marshes shelter a diverse array of birdlife, from painted storks to the rare Siberian crane. Further east, Odisha’s Chilika Lake, which is India’s largest coastal lagoon, comes alive with several migratory birds, including elegant flamingos, making it a prime spot for birdwatching this time of year.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Himalayas, Pangot, near Nainital, offers sightings of rare species like the Himalayan rubythroat, while Assam’s Dibru-Saikhowa National Park is a refuge for both birds and birdwatchers alike. Even in bustling Gujarat, the salt pans of the Little Rann of Kutch come alive with greater flamingos and raptors.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "For those willing to embrace early mornings and quiet patience, birding in India is a revelation — where many a rustling branch and distant call hints at a rare sighting.\n",
